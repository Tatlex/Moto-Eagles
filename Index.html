    <p id="main_paragraph">A motorcycle, often called a motorbike, bike, or cycle, is a two- or three-wheeled motor vehicle.
        Motorcycle design varies greatly to suit a range of different purposes: long-distance travel, commuting, cruising, sport including racing, and off-road riding.
        Motorcycling is riding a motorcycle and related social activity such as joining a motorcycle club and attending motorcycle rallies.
        The 1885 Daimler Reitwagen made by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in Germany was the first internal combustion, petroleum fueled motorcycle.
        In 1894, Hildebrand & Wolfmüller became the first series production motorcycle.
        In 2014, the three top motorcycle producers globally by volume were Honda (28%), Yamaha (17%) (both from Japan), and Hero MotoCorp (India).In developing countries, motorcycles are considered utilitarian due to lower prices and greater fuel economy.
        Of all the motorcycles in the world, 58% are in the Asia-Pacific and Southern and Eastern Asia regions, excluding car-centric Japan.
        According to the US Department of Transportation, the number of fatalities per vehicle mile traveled was 37 times higher for motorcycles than for cars.</p>
